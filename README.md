* Project Overview
House price prediction is a common application of machine learning in the real estate industry. This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices using basic features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the square foot area. The model helps in estimating the market value of a house based on its characteristics.

* Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about houses such as:

* Number of Bedrooms
* Number of Bathrooms
* Square Foot Area
* Price
The data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for training the linear regression model.

* Model Architecture
The model uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict house prices. The steps involved are:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for the model.
Model Training: Training the linear regression model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
* Training
The model was trained using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables if any.
Normalize features if necessary.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the testing data.
* Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. The results indicate how well the model can predict house prices based on the given features.
